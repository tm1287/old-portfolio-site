### The Internship Initiative LLC. - Jan 2020 - Ongoing
#### Introduction

I joined The Internship Initiative at the start of 2020 as a Systems Developer. At the time, my tasks simply involved maintenance and upkeep of the business website and other small technical tasks. A couple of months later, a grant from The BUzz Lab in Boston made it possible to support a migration of backend services to AWS. I piloted the movement with a migration of our business website from Bluehost to Amazon Lightsail. Eventually, following increasing demand for our services, the need for a revised application process arose. As the frontend development team developed a new application portal, I built a data processing infrastructure from the ground up. Read more about it below.
