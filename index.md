### The Scholastic Artificial Intelligence League (Liftoff 2021) - Jun 2021 - Ongoing
#### Introduction
I began contracting with The Scholastic Artificial Intelligence League (SAILea) in June of 2021 as a Competition Organizer. I was tasked with creating a fullstack application to run SAILeaâ€™s premier AI and programming competition, Liftoff 2021. First and foremost, this entailed the design and creation of a React web application to serve as a competition homepage. Additionally, this required me to orchestrate a backend infrastructure on AWS capable of hosting the React webapp, validating and grading problem submissions, and simulating and scoring AI submissions. Read more about it below.

### The Internship Initiative LLC. - Jan 2020 - Ongoing
#### Introduction

I joined The Internship Initiative at the start of 2020 as a Systems Developer. At the time, my tasks simply involved maintenance and upkeep of the business website and other small technical tasks. A couple of months later, a grant from The BUzz Lab in Boston made it possible to support a migration of backend services to AWS. I piloted the movement with a migration of our business website from Bluehost to Amazon Lightsail. Eventually, following increasing demand for our services, the need for a revised application process arose. As the frontend development team developed a new application portal, I built a data processing infrastructure from the ground up. Read more about it below.
